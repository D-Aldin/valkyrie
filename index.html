      The wind howled through the crumbling towers of Blackfang Keep, a fortress swallowed by time and darkness. The air
      reeked of rusted iron and old bones. Valkyrie, a warrior bound by oath, stepped through the ruined gates, her
      blade humming with restless energy. The dead did not sleep here—they waited. Bones rattled in the shadows.
      Skeletons lurched from the blackened halls, swords in their bony grasp. Valkyrie spun, steel flashing, shattering
      skulls with every strike. But these were just the echoes of a greater evil. Deep within the keep’s heart, the
      Minotaur ruled—a monstrous fusion of man and beast, its horns carved from the castle’s own cursed stone. It
      breathed in the dark, chains clinking as it rose from its throne of bones. "You should not have come, little
      storm," it growled. Valkyrie tightened her grip. The final battle had begun.
